## Outcome

Describe the user-visible result. Name the target game and exact version when
this is compatibility work.

## Evidence and implementation

Give the reproduction, relevant log or probe, root-cause finding, and why this
is the smallest useful fix. Explain the boundary around any partial
implementation or game-specific workaround.

## Validation

- [ ] `cargo fmt --all -- --check`
- [ ] Relevant unit or TestApp test
- [ ] `cargo test -- --skip test_app`
- [ ] `cargo build --release`
- [ ] Exact target game launched on Windows
- [ ] `python dev-scripts/compatibility.py check`

List the checks actually run, Windows/CPU/GPU details for game validation, and
any skipped checks with their reason.

## Provenance and agents

List material public documentation, behavioral tests, or compatibly licensed
code used. Name any AI agent/tool that materially assisted and what a human
verified.

- [ ] No game binaries, assets, keys, personal data, or unauthorized links are
      included.
- [ ] No leaked/private Apple implementation material or incompatible code was
      used.
- [ ] Upstream changes were reviewed under `dev-docs/upstream-sync.md`.
- [ ] Any compatibility result used an exact Archive content-hash-verified
      artifact on a committed tapHLE revision; no dirty-worktree result was
      entered in the database.
