# Percy compatibility work note

Last updated: 2026-07-18.

## Identity and source

- Work branch: `compat/percy`.
- Archive item: <https://archive.org/details/ios-ipa-com.deluxe.pipes>.
- Tested file: `Percy Jackson & The Olympians: The Lightning Thief (v1.0) [Decrypted].ipa`.
- SHA-256: `67a4981113d76f796fd706be321db92d2ca376e3ec83c333478cc8fc63f680ca`.
- MD5: `84a94d85e26af00b4594d7bba03cae77`.
- SHA-1: `d6860631a08b4909dd93dc11b50fb22a49ac2809`.
- Bundle: `com.deluxe.Pipes`, version `1.0`, minimum OS `3.1.2`.

The verified IPA is also kept locally in `tapHLE_apps` for playtesting. All
IPA/app binaries and extracted assets for every compatibility target follow
the same rule: keep them local, ignored by Git, and do not redistribute them.

## Current checkpoint

The current Percy work reaches live gameplay on Windows. The
navigation-controller NIB stack is restored, modal presentation and dismissal
work through the level intro, C++ object constructors/destructors run in the
required order, and the game creates drawable storage. Same-process captures
before and after a controlled tap at `(148,172)` show the selected tile changing
from a vertical segment to a horizontal segment while the randomized board
stays fixed.

The Instructions screen now decodes and renders its archived text, font, color,
and bullet spacing. Its **Main Menu** button pops the view controller without a
crash and returns to a framebuffer identical to the known-good menu.

The CAF/AIFF audio paths now decode Percy's PCM effects, including the CAF
asset whose data chunk has a nonzero edit-count field. Sound was confirmed in
manual playtesting, although longer sessions and every effect still need
broader validation.

## Known gaps

- On one dirty 2026-07-18 run, the maintainer saw and heard the Fox logo, then
  saw a black screen while sound continued. A later run produced visible output
  and sound. Instrumented captures now show both the complete decoded main menu
  inside Core Animation and the correctly rotated final presented frame,
  including all menu labels. The earlier black result is therefore intermittent
  or launch/build-specific, not a missing menu or failed image decode. Confirm
  the route again from a clean release build before calling a checkpoint.
- The compatibility changes still need an exact clean-commit release build and
  final Windows replay before the database report can move to that commit.
- Full-session stability, saving, and every game mode are not yet validated;
  the custom-level crash belongs to the separate Ricky investigation, not
  Percy.
- Input coverage is only partially validated; continue with deterministic
  taps and then expand to gestures and controls.
- The desktop screenshot path can appear black with OpenGL; use the EAGL or
  presented Core Animation capture that matches the active rendering path, then
  confirm behavior manually.
- General dirty-layout scheduling and untested game APIs remain future work.

## Reproduction route

From the repository root, run the release executable with no path to use the
picker, or pass the exact verified IPA path directly. For the current route:

1. Pick Percy and tap **Play** on the main menu (near `(35,300)`).
2. Select **Level 1** (client coordinate near `(58,135)`).
3. Tap **Play** on the level-intro screen (near `(420,120)`).
4. Wait for the board, then tap a pipe tile (the deterministic harness uses
   portrait client coordinates near `(148,172)`).

The main-menu **Instructions** button is near `(150,299)`. On that screen,
**Main Menu** is near `(240,289)`.

Use a title-bar click first when automating Windows input so the first client
click is not consumed solely by focus activation. Record the exact Archive
filename and hashes in every compatibility report.
