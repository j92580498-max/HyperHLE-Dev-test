## Highest milestone: 3-star (In game), tapHLE `730f2c29`

Reproduced from a clean committed release build (window title
`ShotShotShoot (tapHLE 730f2c29)`, no `-dirty`).

Menu renders with START and the four mode buttons (Tutorial, Player vs Player,
Computer Easy, Computer Hard). START enters the tutorial level. Tapping the
shoot region fires: shot trails rise, ammo squares in the middle row are
consumed, the ammo bar shortens, and the centre enemy block is destroyed.
Colours are randomised per run, so the same level looks different each time.

### Click map

No launch options; client window 1024x768; ~22 s menu wait.

1. Menu -> `(512, 384)` START -> tutorial level.
2. Level -> `(800, 384)`, `(880, 384)`, `(950, 384)` -> shots fire.

**Coordinate warning.** The frame capture is the pre-rotation EAGL renderbuffer
and is 768x1024 *portrait*, while the client area is 1024x768 *landscape*. So a
position read off a capture is not a client coordinate: client X maps from
capture Y. Centre maps to centre, which is why START worked immediately, but
the shoot region — near the bottom of the capture — is at high client X, not
low client Y. Three taps at low X did nothing before this was worked out.

## Fixes this required

Both general, both on `trunk` in `32ac92f0`.

1. `-[NSString initWithContentsOfFile:encoding:error:]` lacked the nil-path
   guard its single-argument sibling already had, so a nil path reached
   `to_rust_string()` and panicked. It also asserted that the caller had *not*
   passed an `NSError**`, which would abort any app that did. Both fixed, and
   the NSURL variant got the same treatment.
2. `ObjC::borrow`/`borrow_mut` used a bare `unwrap()` on the object-table
   lookup, so a miss reported only "called `Option::unwrap()` on a `None`
   value" — no object, no type, no lead. It now names both and states the two
   usual causes. **This is what found bug 1**: the improved message showed the
   object was literally nil and the wanted host type was `StringHostObject`,
   which pointed straight at the string initialiser.

Tap Tap Revenge 2 fails at the same `objects.rs` site when loading a track, so
that app should be re-run now that the message is informative — it may be a
different cause, but it is no longer blind.

## Known limitations at this rating

- Only the tutorial was played, and only far enough to destroy one block.
  Whether the tutorial can be completed is unknown.
- Player vs Player, Computer Easy and Computer Hard were never opened.
- Steering ("swipe left and right") was not exercised, only tapping.
- `Unable to load settings.xml check data/ folder` is printed at startup; the
  game continues with defaults.
- Audio was not measured. `SoundEngine initialized` is logged.

## Checks run

- `cargo fmt --all -- --check`
- `cargo test --workspace --lib` (93 passed)
- `cargo build --release`

## 2026-07-27: 3 stars re-confirmed

Re-driven after a session of broad UIKit and CoreGraphics changes, using the
taps already in this note — `(512, 384)`, then `(800, 384)`, `(880, 384)`,
`(950, 384)`. That reaches the interactive tutorial, which is playable: the
target row, the ammo squares, the shooting region and both ammo gauges all
render, and a projectile is in flight. Two captures eight seconds apart differ
by SHA-256.

**The capture is small — about 26 KB — and that is not a warning sign here.**
This game's art is flat colour on white, so it compresses to a fraction of what
a photographic title produces. Judging health by capture size would flag this
app as blank; look at the image.

Verified on a build of `0d8f5ec8`, whose only source difference from `trunk` is
a `log_dbg!` added to `ca_eagl_layer.rs`.
