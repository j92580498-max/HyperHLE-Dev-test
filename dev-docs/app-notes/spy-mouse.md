# SPYmouse HD compatibility work note

- Work branch; this investigation started from `compat/spy-mouse` at
  `fec8bcb1`.
- Local test artifact: `SPYmouseHD_v1.1.1_os32.ipa`; SHA-256
  `92b4712f4c15d17c83c237692126275519583568b115ddeeb69507669adaaeb5`.
- Artifact provenance: the maintainer confirmed this local IPA is the right
  target for this work. It is content-hash-verified against the original
  `SPYmouseHD_v1.1.1_os32.ipa` in
  `https://archive.org/details/ios_3_2_ipa`: MD5
  `329a4efcd51ca1b5005bbeda3ac49628`, SHA-1
  `9474d90a85215ece455c4046fd9e28bd456b7c05`, and locally calculated SHA-256
  `92b4712f4c15d17c83c237692126275519583568b115ddeeb69507669adaaeb5`.
- Availability check (2026-07-24): no current App Store listing was found for
  this exact EA bundle/version. Apple does list a separate modern app with a
  similar name by Dram Inc.; that is not a claim about the availability or
  legal status of this legacy EA build.
- Runtime milestone: on Windows, the `bddd7c91` release build of this exact
  artifact clears KVC's `dictionaryWithValuesForKeys:`, custom `NSDictionary`
  subclass key enumeration, `NSAssertionHandler`, `NSException`, `NSMachPort`,
  input-port registration, `dladdr`, `CCHmac`, `NSData` formatting, RFC-2396
  percent escaping, immutable dictionary values, guest `statfs`, and
  `CTTelephonyNetworkInfo`. It executes the game's offline ad/tracking failure
  handling, initializes its tracking database, displays the SPYmouse splash,
  and enters an active level after a tap. The level's HUD, mouse, cheese, and
  board remained visible and the process remained responsive 20 seconds later.
- Rating evidence: this is a three-star agent result: a gameplay loop starts
  and persists on the confirmed local IPA. The online-ad requests still fail
  offline as expected, and the runtime logs repeated missing-file warnings,
  but neither prevented the level from running.
- Current implementation: reusable Foundation KVC/dictionary, data, assertion,
  exception, Mach-port, and run-loop behavior; CommonCrypto HMAC-SHA1/MD5;
  a standard failed `dladdr` lookup; and a CoreTelephony device-information
  fallback which reports the documented no-cellular-provider result. The
  exception and input-port fallbacks are explicitly bounded until Objective-C
  unwinding and generic port delivery are implemented.
- Current frontier: the three-star milestone is complete. A human may assess
  the game for four stars; do not change this agent rating without a new exact
  artifact run.
- Checks passed: `cargo metadata --no-deps --format-version 1`,
  `cargo fmt --all -- --check`, `git diff --check`, and `cargo build --release`.
  The exact IPA was launched on Windows after that release build and reached a
  persistent active level. `cargo test --workspace --lib` was attempted but
  failed before tests because the debug target refers to an unavailable former
  worktree, Boost is absent, and CMake is not on the debug-build PATH. The
  TestApp suite likewise remains unavailable without its custom SDK/LLVM.
- Compatibility database: submitted the three-star `source_type: agent` result
  for `bddd7c91` on 2026-07-24 after the content-hash verification. It created
  app 6, version 6, and report 10, all pending maintainer moderation.

## 2026-07-27: REGRESSION to two stars, tapHLE `53bc1f24`

**The three-star result above no longer reproduces.** The app now reaches the EA
splash logo and aborts before any level:

```text
Object (class "_tapHLE_NSArray") does not respond to selector "serialize"!
```

Filed as report 46 (★★☆☆☆). A regression is a result, so it is recorded rather
than left as a stale three-star claim.

### Cause

The app bundles `AS_NSArrayJSONSerializable`, a **guest subclass of NSArray**.
tapHLE hands a guest subclass of NSArray a plain `_tapHLE_NSArray`, so the
object loses its own class and the `serialize` its subclass defines is not
found.

Until 2026-07-27 the same path hit `assert!(this == NSArray)` in
`+[NSArray allocWithZone:]` instead — also fatal, one step earlier. So **the
regression is older than that change**, which only moved where it dies. It was
confirmed by bisect: the assertion fires identically on `cc492376` and
`b1de9e9e`. The commit that first broke it has not been identified.

### Why it is not fixed yet

The real fix is to let a guest subclass of NSArray inherit tapHLE's concrete
implementation, since the array primitives (`count`, `objectAtIndex:`) live on
`_tapHLE_NSArray` and not on `NSArray`. An instance of the subclass allocated
today would have no storage at all. Two ways:

1. **Re-parent at class registration.** When a guest class's superclass
   resolves to `NSArray`, substitute `_tapHLE_NSArray`. `ClassHostObject::
   from_bin` is the place, and tapHLE already has both class substitution and
   ivar-offset reconciliation. The obstacle is mechanical: `from_bin` holds
   `&Mem`, and `get_known_class` wants `&mut Mem`.
2. **Make `NSArray` itself concrete**, moving the primitives up from
   `_tapHLE_NSArray`. Larger, and it would retire the sibling-class trap that
   has cost this codebase repeated rebuild cycles.

This is the same shape as the `_tapHLE_NSString` / `_tapHLE_NSMutableString`
problem, so whichever is chosen should be applied to strings and dictionaries
too rather than to arrays alone.

### What still works

Startup, the offline ad/tracking failure handling, and the splash. The window
stays up for roughly forty seconds before the abort, so a sweep that captures
early sees a healthy-looking app — which is how this went unnoticed. A
regression check for this app must drive it to a level, not merely confirm the
process is alive.
