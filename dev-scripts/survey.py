"""Survey where every app in a collection stops, and rank the causes by frequency.

The database calls "where an app stops" its *frontier*. This records the frontier
of every app in a local collection at once, then ranks the causes, so work is
chosen by measurement instead of by whichever app happened to be looked at. Two
apps fixed in one session — JellyCar 3 and Scoops — turned out to die on the
*same* missing constant, found by accident hours apart. A survey surfaces that as
one row with a count of two, and across a large collection probably thirty.

    python dev-scripts/survey.py run   --apps "D:\\my ipas"
    python dev-scripts/survey.py rank
    python dev-scripts/survey.py rank --symbols
    python dev-scripts/survey.py show "selector:UIAlertView.setMessage:"
    python dev-scripts/survey.py candidates

`run` is resumable: it skips any app already surveyed for the current tapHLE
revision, so an interrupted overnight run continues where it stopped. Re-run it
after each batch of fixes; the ranking is a moving target and that iteration is
the product, not the first snapshot.

## The result file is private and must never be committed

It lists the apps in someone's personal collection, which is theirs to disclose
or not. The default output path is outside the repository for that reason, and
`.gitignore` covers the pattern in case one is written inside anyway. Share
findings — "thirty apps want this selector" — not the file.

## What this measures, and what it does not

A row is a **lower bound observed under one unattended run of a few seconds**. It
is not a compatibility rating, and must never be filed as one:

- Nothing here presses a button, so any app whose first screen needs a tap looks
  stuck even when it is fine.
- Some apps need an orientation option to render correctly at all.
- Clearing the first break says nothing about the second. Scoops' first break was
  a single missing constant, with seven more fixes behind it.

So the ranking orders *unblocking* work — the cheap fixes that clear the most
apps — rather than work-to-three-stars. `candidates` lists rows worth a closer
look; turning one into a database report means actually running that app and
reading its identity with `tapHLE --info`, per `compatibility/README.md`. This
script deliberately cannot file reports.
