//! Where the frontend keeps its own files, and how they are read and written.
//!
//! Everything here is machine-local: which apps this computer knows about,
//! how long they have been played, what this user set. None of it is a
//! compatibility claim, and none of it is meant to be shared — that
//! distinction is why the local star rating in [crate::compat] never
//! overwrites a database rating.
//!
//! The files live in a `tapHLE_frontend` directory beside `tapHLE_sandbox`
//! and `tapHLE_apps`, so a portable install stays portable: copying the
//! tapHLE directory to another machine carries the library with it. They are
//! ordinary indented JSON, meant to be readable and hand-editable.
