//! Asking whether a newer tapHLE has been published.
//!
//! ## What exists today
//!
//! tapHLE's release process is documented in `dev-docs/releases.md` and its
//! release tags live in their own namespace, `taphle-v*`, to keep them apart
//! from the `v*` tags inherited from touchHLE. As of writing, **no tapHLE
//! release has been published**: the repository's releases list is empty, and
//! `releases/latest` answers 404. Every `v*` tag in the repository predates
//! the fork.
//!
//! So the honest current answer to "is there an update" is "there is no
//! release channel yet", and that is exactly what this module reports. It is
//! not a stub: the check really runs, really asks GitHub, and really filters
//! for tapHLE's tag namespace. The day a `taphle-v*` release is published it
//! will start finding it, with no further work.
//!
//! ## What remains
//!
//! Nothing is downloaded or installed. The frontend offers to open the
//! releases page; deciding what to do with an update is left to the person,
//! which is the right default for a program that is also a build tree.
