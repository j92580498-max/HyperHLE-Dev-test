//! Compiler builtins from libgcc / compiler-rt, and the C++ ABI's allocation
//! operators.
//!
//! The ARM cores these apps target have no integer divide instruction, so the
//! compiler turns every `/` and `%` on an integer into a call to one of the
//! helpers below. That makes them unusually load-bearing: an app missing them
//! does not fail at some optional feature, it fails at arithmetic. A survey of
//! 1501 apps found `__udivsi3` alone blocking fourteen.
//!
//! Resources:
//! - The [Run-time ABI for the ARM Architecture](https://github.com/ARM-software/abi-aa/blob/main/rtabi32/rtabi32.rst)

// Conversion between 64-bit integers and floating point.
//
// VFP converts between a float and a *32-bit* integer in one instruction, but
// it has no 64-bit form, so every widening or narrowing conversion involving a
// `long long` becomes a call to one of the eight helpers below. Managed
// runtimes reach them constantly, because a language whose integer type is
// 64-bit does this on ordinary arithmetic rather than at some unusual boundary.
//
// These take the *base* AAPCS convention — operands and results in the core
// registers, not VFP — even though surrounding iOS code is AAPCS-VFP. That
// is not an assumption: at a `___fixdfdi` call site an app moves its double out
// of a VFP register with `vmov r0, r1, d16` immediately before branching, and
// reads a `___floatdidf` result straight back out of `r0`/`r1`. tapHLE's
// `GuestArg`/`GuestRet` for `f32` and `f64` already marshal through the core
// registers, so declaring the float types here is correct as written.
//
// Only the legacy libgcc spellings are exported. The ARM run-time ABI's
// `__aeabi_l2d`/`__aeabi_d2lz` family is the same set of operations under
// different names, but the Apple toolchain does not emit those, so nothing
// would resolve against them.
