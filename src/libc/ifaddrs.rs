//! `ifaddrs.h` (interface addresses)
//!
//! Apps reach for this to answer one of two questions: what is my own IP
//! address, and is there a network at all. The interfaces reported here are
//! synthetic and deterministic, matching the set [crate::libc::net::if_] indexes
//! and the `en0` that [crate::libc::sysctl] describes. Exposing the host
//! computer's real adapters would be both a privacy leak and a source of
//! run-to-run variation in a game's behaviour.
