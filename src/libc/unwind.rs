//! `unwind.h` — the setjmp/longjmp flavour of the Itanium unwinder.
//!
//! ARM iPhone OS binaries are built with SjLj exception handling rather than
//! table-driven unwinding, so the compiler emits a call to
//! `_Unwind_SjLj_Register` on entry to *any* function containing a `try` block
//! or a cleanup, and `_Unwind_SjLj_Unregister` on the way out. The registration
//! maintains a per-thread linked list of function contexts that a later throw
//! would walk.
//!
//! That registration happens whether or not anything is ever thrown, which is
//! why this matters so much in practice: a survey of 1501 apps found
//! `_Unwind_SjLj_Register` to be the second most common reason an app died
//! before reaching its own code, in 87 of them. Almost none of those were
//! throwing — they were merely *able* to.
//!
//! So the bookkeeping is implemented and throwing is not. Maintaining the list
//! is exact and cheap; unwinding through it needs the personality routine and
//! the LSDA of every frame, which is a much larger piece of work. An app that
//! actually throws is told so plainly rather than being allowed to continue on
//! a corrupted context chain.
//!
//! Resources:
//! - libgcc's `unwind-sjlj.c`, which defines the context layout and the
//!   register/unregister contract.
