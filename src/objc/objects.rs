//! Handling of Objective-C objects.
//!
//! Note that classes and metaclasses are objects too!
//!
//! Resources:
//! - [Apple's documentation of `id`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/objectivec/id)
//!   (which for some reason omits that `id` is a pointer type)
//!
//! To make things easier for the host code, our implementation will maintain
//! two linked representations of an object: an [objc_object] struct allocated
//! in guest memory, which needs to maintain the same ABI that Apple's runtime
//! does, and a [HostObject] trait object allocated in host memory, which can be
//! used for any data that only our host code needs to access. As a bonus we get
//! some resilience against guest memory corruption.
//!
//! See also: [crate::frameworks::foundation::ns_object].
