Integration tests
=================

This directory contains integration tests written in Objective-C. They're compiled to a fat (ARMv6 + ARMv7) Mach-O binary and packaged into a bundle (`TestApp.app`) so that they can be run in the emulator like a normal iPhone OS app.

`TestApp.app` is effectively two completely different apps:

- When launched normally, it is a UIKit app that allows us to do manual testing of various UI-related things.
- When launched with the `--cli-tests` command-line argument, it is a command-line app that runs a suite of automated tests.

The code in `integration.rs` builds `TestApp.app` and runs the CLI tests in tapHLE. Running `cargo test` will run both these CLI tests and the unit tests written in Rust.

The resulting `TestApp.app` binary can also be run on a real iOS device, if it is jailbroken (to bypass the normal signature checks). The `./make-ipa.sh` script can turn the app into an IPA file to simplify installation. The app doesn't fully work on iOS yet: when tested 2025-10-05 on a 3rd-gen iPod touch running iOS 5.1.1, the CLI tests segfaulted after around a dozen tests had been executed.

Building
--------

### Compiler Setup

Clang is required to build the TestApp binary, and should be placed (or symlinked) at `tests/llvm/bin/clang`. While modern versions of clang may work fine, only clang 12 (listed below) is tested and used in CI.

* [LLVM 12.0.1 Windows x64 release binaries](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases/download/llvmorg-12.0.1/LLVM-12.0.1-win64.exe) (extract it with 7-zip)
* [LLVM 12.0.0 macOS x64 release binaries](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases/download/llvmorg-12.0.0/clang+llvm-12.0.0-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.xz) (extract it with `tar -xf`)
* [Other versions](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases/tag/llvmorg-12.0.0) (though you might need to build LLVM yourself, sorry :c)

Extract LLVM to `tests/llvm`, so that `tests/llvm/bin/clang` (with `.exe` suffix, on Windows) is the path to Clang.

### Linker setup

A [custom SDK](https://github.com/touchHLE/common-3.0-sdk) from the upstream project, with headers and a multiplatform version of Apple's `ld`, is required to build the TestApp binary. CI uses the reviewed `v0.3.7` release. Download that exact release (or follow its instructions to compile it), verify the checksum below, then extract/place/symlink the resultant directories as shown below. On Windows, the precompiled archive avoids a mingw build dependency.

| Archive | SHA-256 |
| --- | --- |
| `common-3.0.sdk-macOS-universal.tar.gz` | `16cedbc008841b8367037e36826385947d8a9aa4125b825707f7923bad834498` |
| `common-3.0.sdk-windows-x86_64.tar.gz` | `c616f77aa309cca34813f5f5a3207fc27e830d235dd3d45f352fe0db01fafc8e` |

The overall structure of the tests directory should look like the following:
```
- tests
  - integration.rs
  - llvm
    - bin
      - clang
  - common-3.0.sdk
    - usr
      - lib
        - (sdk libraries)
      - include
        - (sdk headers)
      - bin
        - ld(.exe)
        - lipo(.exe)
  - TestApp_source
  - TestApp.app
  - stubs
  - make-ipa.sh
```
